            Remember, Python is one of the most versatile programming languages
            available, so it can be used for almost any kind of development
            project. You can use it to build desktop software and web
            development. A python developer can also use it to develop for IoT,
            the blockchain, data science processes, and advanced systems like
            machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). It's even used to
            create and apply special effects in films.
